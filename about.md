I am a Software Engineer living in SF. Recently I've been spending my time working through [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/), messing around with functional programming, and learning about cryptocurrencies! In my free time I enjoy getting outdoors and reading books (currently reading [Shogun](http://www.amazon.com/Shogun-James-Clavell/dp/0440178002) by James Clavell).
